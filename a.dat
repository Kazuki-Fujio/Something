and if change or make files, we should command 1,"git add"
This command prepares uploads, so I have not uploaded yet.
So we shoud command 2,"git commit -m 'some comment' "
Lastly, command 3,"git push"  And put password. Username is "Kazuki-Fujio" Pass is "M1996417m"
This is all for uploads.

And if you want to renew the files, you need to command "git pull"
